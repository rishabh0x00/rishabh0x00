# Hi, I’m Rishabh Sharma 👋

## About me

I’m a **Blockchain Engineer and Protocol Architect** with **7+ years of experience** building production-grade systems across **DeFi, protocol infrastructure, wallets, and execution layers**. I entered the blockchain space in **2019**, driven by the idea of a truly **permissionless and decentralized financial system**, and since then I’ve worked end-to-end—from low-level protocol components to user-facing applications operating at real economic scale.

My early work focused on **core blockchain infrastructure**, including **bridges, rollups, multisig wallets, and DeFi protocols**. Over time, I expanded into building **NFT ecosystems, marketplaces, and derivatives-based AMMs**, while also leading **security reviews, upgrades, and migrations** of large-scale smart contract systems—preventing high-impact exploits and improving long-term protocol resilience.

As my interests evolved, I moved deeper into **protocol-level design and execution architecture**. This includes architecting **shared security and AVS-style systems**, staking and slashing frameworks, **commit–reveal and attestation pipelines**, and **cross-chain coordination mechanisms**. More recently, I’ve worked extensively on **intent-based execution models, MEV-aware design, and account abstraction**, building systems that decouple **user intent** from **execution strategy** while preserving trust-minimized, on-chain settlement.

Alongside on-chain work, I’ve built and maintained **off-chain infrastructure**—including solvers, bundlers, indexers, and backend services—that tightly integrate with smart contracts. I place a strong emphasis on **correctness, security, and operability**, backed by audit exposure, formal verification efforts, invariant testing, fuzzing, and fork-based simulations using **Foundry and Hardhat**.

Today, I enjoy operating at the intersection of **engineering depth, system design, and product ownership**—designing scalable primitives, reviewing architectures, and guiding teams to ship secure, maintainable protocol infrastructure. My motivation remains the same as when I started: to help push decentralized systems closer to real-world usability without compromising on trust or security.
