# Hi, I'm Rishabh Sharma ðŸ‘‹

## About me

With over six years of experience in the blockchain industry, Iâ€™ve built a wide range of solutions across DeFi, NFTs, cross-chain interoperability, and Layer 2 scalability. My fascination with the idea of a truly decentralized and permissionless world initially drew me into this space in 2019, and since then Iâ€™ve been fortunate to work on everything from protocol infrastructure to advanced application-layer products.

I started my career working on core blockchain infrastructure, including bridges, rollups, multisig wallets, and DeFi protocols. Over time, I expanded into building NFT ecosystems, marketplaces, and derivatives-based AMMs, while also leading efforts in auditing and upgrading large-scale smart contracts to prevent high-impact exploits. My experience with Solidity, Layer 2s, and cross-chain tooling has allowed me to design secure, scalable systems that balance usability with decentralization.

To push my limits further, I moved into architecting protocol-level innovations, including commit-reveal systems, cross-chain bridges, and most recently, a **shared security abstraction layer** that unifies blockchain security models and enables scalable trust across networks. Alongside this, Iâ€™ve worked extensively with MEV-aware design, intent-based execution systems, and decentralized infrastructure patterns that ensure fairness and resilience.

In addition to professional work, Iâ€™ve actively pursued personal projects around interoperability and testing frameworks, leveraging tools like Foundry for fuzzing, invariants, and fork testing. Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve stayed committed to writing efficient, community-standard Solidity code with strong test coverage and clear documentationâ€”practices that ensure both security and long-term maintainability.

My dedication to blockchain technology and to shaping the decentralized future remains as strong today as when I first started.
